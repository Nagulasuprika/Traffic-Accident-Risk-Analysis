Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Statistical Analysis
Audience: Data Analysts, Business Strategists, Recruiters

Executive Summary
In June 2025, QuickBite Express - a Bengaluru-based food delivery startup (founded 2020) - faced a critical crisis triggered by:

Viral food safety incident involving partner restaurants
Week-long delivery infrastructure outage during monsoon season
Aggressive competitor campaigns capitalizing on operational failures
Crisis Impact:

73,000 customers churned (70% of active base)
₹27 million revenue lost in 4 months
Customer ratings collapsed from 4.5 → 2.3 stars
20% restaurant partner exodus
Key Discovery: Despite the severity, 30% of churned customers (22,000) were recoverable because they left due to operational failure, not dissatisfaction.

Key Fields & Definitions
Phase Classification:

Pre-Crisis: January - May 2025 (5 months baseline)
Crisis: June - September 2025 (4 months of operational failure)
Customer Segmentation: Total Customers: 105,000 (all unique customers) Active (Pre-Crisis): 100,000 (placed 1+ orders Jan-May) Active (Crisis): 27,000 (placed 1+ orders Jun-Sep) Churned: 73,000 (orders pre-crisis, ZERO orders crisis) New: 18,000 (first order Jun-Sep 2025) Retained: 14,000 (orders in both periods)

Order Metrics: Pre-Crisis Monthly Average: 24,000 orders/month Crisis Monthly Average: 9,000 orders/month Decline: 69% (24K → 9K)

Revenue Metrics: Pre-Crisis Total: ₹3.8 Crore (5 months) Crisis Total: ₹1.1 Crore (4 months) Difference: ₹2.7 Crore lost Decline: 71%

🔬 Methodology
1. Data Analysis Framework
A. Descriptive Analysis
Purpose: Understand current state and crisis severity

Metrics Calculated:

Order volume by month, city, cuisine
Revenue by component (subtotal, delivery fee, discounts)
Customer counts by status (active, churned, new, retained)
Cancellation rates and SLA compliance trends
Average ratings and sentiment scores
Tools: Power BI aggregations, DAX measures, statistical functions

B. Comparative Analysis
Purpose: Quantify pre-crisis vs crisis changes

Methodology: Decline % = (Pre-Crisis Value - Crisis Value) / Pre-Crisis Value × 100 Example - Order Decline: = (24,000 - 9,000) / 24,000 × 100 = 69% decline

Applied to: Orders, revenue, ratings, cancellations, SLA compliance

C. Customer Segmentation
Purpose: Identify recoverable customers

Segmentation Criteria:

High Return Probability (60% return chance): IF (Pre-Crisis Orders ≥ 5) AND (Pre-Crisis Avg Rating ≥ 4.5) AND (Crisis Orders = 0) THEN "High Return - Recoverable" Sample Size: 22,000 customers Rationale: Loyal customers lost due to failure, not dissatisfaction

Medium Return Probability (40% return chance): IF (Pre-Crisis Orders = 3-4) AND (Pre-Crisis Avg Rating ≥ 3.5) AND (Crisis Orders = 0) THEN "Medium Return - Price Sensitive" Sample Size: 28,000 customers Rationale: Mixed experience, cost-conscious, can be won back

Medium Return Probability (40% return chance): IF (Pre-Crisis Orders = 3-4) AND (Pre-Crisis Avg Rating ≥ 3.5) AND (Crisis Orders = 0) THEN "Medium Return - Price Sensitive" Sample Size: 28,000 customers Rationale: Mixed experience, cost-conscious, can be won back

Low Return Probability (15% return chance): IF (Pre-Crisis Orders ≤ 2) AND (Pre-Crisis Avg Rating < 3.5) THEN "Low Return - Low Priority" Sample Size: 23,000 customers Rationale: Never engaged fully, low potential

D. Revenue Impact Analysis
Purpose: Quantify financial loss across components

Revenue Breakdown: Total Revenue = Subtotal Amount + Delivery Fee + Discounts Applied Pre-Crisis Subtotal: ₹36.34 Cr Crisis Subtotal: ₹10.56 Cr Subtotal Decline: 70.95% Pre-Crisis Delivery Fee: ₹3.47 Cr Crisis Delivery Fee: ₹1.01 Cr Delivery Fee Decline: 70.84% Pre-Crisis Discounts: ₹2.19 Cr Crisis Discounts: ₹0.63 Cr Discount Decline: 71.34% Total Revenue Lost: ₹27 million (70.92% decline)

E. Sentiment Analysis
Purpose: Understand customer perception changes

Sentiment Scoring Method: Rating-Based Sentiment:

Rating 4.5-5.0: Positive (1.0) Rating 3.5-4.4: Neutral (0.5) Rating 2.5-3.4: Mixed (-0.5) Rating <2.5: Negative (-1.0)

Average Sentiment = Sum of All Sentiment Scores / Total Reviews Pre-Crisis Avg Rating: 4.55 → Positive Sentiment Crisis Avg Rating: 2.30 → Negative Sentiment Sentiment Change: -0.49 (1.42 point drop on -1 to +1 scale)

Keyword Analysis:

Text parsing on 48K reviews
Frequency analysis of negative keywords
Clustering by issue category (food quality, delivery, packaging, etc.)
Crisis vs pre-crisis comparison
2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis
CAC Formula: CAC = Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired Pre-Crisis CAC Estimate: ₹50 per customer Crisis CAC Estimate: ₹150 per customer Increase: 300% (₹50 → ₹150) Contributing Factors (External Research-Backed):

Factor	Impact	Source
18% GST Implementation (Sept 22)	+₹20 CAC	Business Standard, Sept 2025
Google Ads CPC +42%	+₹25 CAC	Market data, competitive bidding
Monsoon Seasonality (-15-20% orders)	+₹15 CAC	Industry reports
Brand Reputation Damage	+₹40 CAC	Calculated from conversion rate drop
Total	+₹100 (300%)	
Implication for Strategy: Reactivation of existing customers (₹50/customer) is 3x more cost-effective than acquiring new customers at ₹150/customer during crisis.

❓ FAQ
Q: How was customer churn calculated?
A: Customers who placed 1+ orders in pre-crisis (Jan-May) but ZERO orders in crisis (Jun-Sep). Result: 73,000 churned out of 100,000 active = 73% churn.

Q: Why only 30% of customers are recoverable?
A: Only those with 5+ pre-crisis orders AND 4.5+ rating qualify. These had established loyalty and left due to failure, not preference. Others had weak engagement or were already dissatisfied.

Q: How reliable is the ROI projection?
A: Based on industry benchmarks (60% reactivation rate for food delivery crisis recovery). Conservative estimate—actual could be higher with execution quality.

Q: What external data was used?
A: Competitor financial reports, industry research papers, market analyses, GST documentation, and peer company case studies. All properly cited.

Q: Can this strategy be adapted?
A: Yes. The framework is transferable to other food delivery/e-commerce crisis scenarios. Key adjustments needed for different markets/sectors.
